            Final Fantasy VI was the sixth installment to the Final Fantasy series and proved to be a landmark game for
            the entire RPG genre. It was released as Final Fantasy III in the U.S. to stay
            sequential to the previous release (FFIV).
            The game has 14 playable characters, which was the biggest cast yet in any Final Fantasy. Much like Final
            Fantsay IV, the character's classes were unchangeable, however, you can equip a new magic/skill system called
            Espers and learn new abilities. The game was a huge hit and helped lift the series into the public eye, to this
            day many RPG and FF fans alike consider this one of the best in the series.
